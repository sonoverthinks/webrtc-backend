To install, run git clone https://github.com/sonoverthinks/webrtc-backend. This project is an Express server that uses MySQL to store user data (username and password) when they sign up. I implement JWT tokens for login and session tracking, with a 1-hour expiration. Once logged in, users connect to a WebSocket.IO server, which allows them to broadcast their presence to other online users. WebSocket.IO acts as an intermediary to connect users, and I also utilize it on the frontend to facilitate peer-to-peer connections. Notably, WebSocket.IO provides helpful abstractions, eliminating the need to connect to STUN servers or handle other WebRTC-related complexities. Note that I haven't quite figured out how to run CI/CD with AWS yet.
